        <h2>What Mora Solves</h2>
        <p>
            Restaurants lose thousands every year from missed calls, long hold times,  
            and flustered staff juggling in-person customers and ringing phones.  
            Mora answers every call instantly, takes accurate orders, handles common  
            questions, and frees your team to focus on what matters most — serving great food.

            Hi, I’m Eric — the creator of Mora. I work in software development with the U.S. Navy  
            and specialize in AI and cloud technologies. Mora was built with one goal in mind:  
            helping local restaurants serve more customers without burning out their team.
