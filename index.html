        <h2>What Mora Solves</h2>
        <p>
            Restaurants lose customers every day because phones ring during rushes. 
            Staff get overwhelmed, callers hang up, and orders get rushed or misheard.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mora removes the chaos by handling every call instantly — taking orders, 
            checking hours, answering menu questions, and passing accurate tickets 
            straight to your POS.

        <h2>Pricing Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
            Fair, transparent pricing. No hidden fees. No long-term contracts. 
            One simple setup fee + a monthly rate — that’s it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Restaurants should pay only for value, not complexity.
